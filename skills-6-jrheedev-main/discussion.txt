Runtime
-------

1)

C) Runtime for letters_in_common:
Answer: O(n)


Stacks and Queues
-----------------


2) Which would be a better data structure for creating a Stack: a Linked List or
   a built-in Python list? Explain why, referencing the runtime requirements for
   Stack operations (push, pop, etc).

   Answer: Built-in Python list

   Runtime requirements for Stack operations like pop are O(1) and we want to have the capability to remove and add items 
   from the end. Other runtime characteristics of linked lists that are O(1) are get item by index, insert/delete at beginning in addition to removing/
   adding items from the end.


3) Which would be a better data structure for creating a Queue: a Linked List or
   a built-in Python list? Explain why, referencing the runtime requirements for
   Queue methods (enqueue, dequeue, etc).

   Answer: Linked-List is a better data structure because both enqueue and dequeue are O(1) operations. Python lists are O(n) operations and point to an array. To insert or
   delete an item in a Python list could require shifting all items based on the new addition or deletion to that original list.



Trees
-----

4) Using the diagram in the instructions, in what order would a Breadth First
   Search (BFS) algorithm visit each node  until finding burritos (starting at
   food)?

   Answer:
   food > italian > indian > mexican > lasagna > pizza > tikka masala > saag > burritos 


5) Using the diagram in the instructions, In what order would a Depth First
   Search (DFS) algorithm visit each node until finding Chicago-style (starting
   at food)?

   Answer: 
   food > mexican > enchiladas > tacos > burritos > indian > saag > tikka masala > italian > pizza > lasagna > sicilian
   > new york-style > chicago-style 


6) How is a binary search tree different from other trees?

   Answer:

   a binary search tree places greater importance on the right node over the left node, making this trait a key differentiator from other trees.
